# Hi :D

So This is where I record the history of the OSCwebsite. This repo does not hold an actual website in production. It merely holds a memory when the community was first starting clueless of what web development means.
All they knew was that there is an idea called Open Source and there are groups that are doing things for the greater good of humanity expecting nothing in return.
And so People started developing this website with their proud but none-existing web development skills that they had at the time.
They produced an absolutely shitty website that no one would ever use. But this shitty website was the greatest things I've ever lied my eyes on. This website resembled true passion and love. It resembled the really giving tree
that had nothing to give but still gave anyway.
Ladies and Gentlemen, to you I proudly present with love: The OSCWebsite.

Checkout the commit history to see how it grew slowly :D

## Amazing people who participated in the development:
